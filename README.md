For this step, we recommend referencing the official Unity ML-Agents Toolkit installation instructions here: https://unity-technologies.github.io/ml-agents/Installation/ 
Here is the summary of that page:

  * Install PyTorch by running the following command: pip3 install torch~=2.2.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
    
  * Clone the ml-agents repository: https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents
    
  * Navigate to the cloned ml-agents, and install the two included python packages from it using pip:

        cd /path/to/ml-agents
    
        python -m pip install ./ml-agents-envs
    
        python -m pip install ./ml-agents
